# DigitalModulation
A small demonstration of the theory behind digital modulation techniques

Featured in this repo are some examples of Binary Amplitude Shift Keying (BASK), Binary Phase Shift Keying (BPSK), and Binary Frequency Shift Keying (BFSK).

Demo.m Generates a digital signal and shows how the signal can be transmitted using each of the three digital modulation techniques.  It also generates random noise (gausian distribution) and shows how it affects each modulation technique.

Final.m Shows, through abstract represenation of the signals, how well each of the digital modulation techniques deals with increasing amounts of noise, and compares it to the theoretical value.
